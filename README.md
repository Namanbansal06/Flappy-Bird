# Flappy Bird

Welcome to Flappy Bird, a simple yet addictive mobile game that took the world by storm!
In Flappy Bird, you take control of a pixelated bird and your mission is to navigate it through a series of obstacles. The objective is straightforward: tap or click the screen to make the bird flap its wings and ascend. The bird's momentum will gradually bring it back down, so you must time your taps carefully to navigate through openings in the pipes or other obstacles.
